# Coronavirus_Datasets
A repository containing some coronavirus datasets I've put together. They're intented for use with AWS forecast, but can be used for anything!
You can do pretty much anything you want with it, I don't mind!

Coronavirus_Italy.csv and UKDailyConfirmedCasesEdited2.csv:

Column 1: Item number for aws - if I had a dataset containing multiple countries infection count, I'd have a different item number for each.

Column 2: Timestamp in yyyy-MM-dd format. 

Column 3: Cumulative infection count.
